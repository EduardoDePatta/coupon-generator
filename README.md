This project is a simple serverless backend application developed as an introduction to AWS operations. It is designed to manage coupons and user interactions using modern backend technologies.

The application demonstrates the use of key AWS services such as:

AWS Lambda: For scalable, serverless API endpoints.
DynamoDB: As the NoSQL database to store user and coupon data.
API Gateway: To expose and manage HTTP endpoints for the application.
CloudWatch: For logging, monitoring, and debugging application execution.
The project was built using Node.js and TypeScript, emphasizing clean, modular code with modern practices. It is structured to showcase the integration of AWS services for serverless applications, while keeping the implementation straightforward and easy to understand.

This application is not intended for production use but serves as a learning tool to explore the core functionalities and operations of AWS serverless technologies.
